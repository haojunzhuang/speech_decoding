mesmerizing poetry.'}, {'sentence_id': 18, 'sentence': 'A work of astonishing delicacy and force.'}, {'sentence_id': 19, 'sentence': &quot;The movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane,

stylish surprises... but that's OK.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 23, 'sentence': &quot;The acting is stiff, the story lacks all trace of wit, the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 24, 'sentence': &quot;This version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true, lived experience.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 25, 'sentence': &quot;There's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes, plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 26, 'sentence': 'A first-class, thoroughly involving B movie

Dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 37, 'sentence': &quot;Featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great Daniel Auteuil, ``Sade'' covers the same period as Kaufmann's ``Quills'' with more unsettlingly realistic results.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 38, 'sentence': &quot;The movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime, and the fanatical excess built into it.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 39, 'sentence': &quot;The Ring is worth a look, if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your Halloween entertainment.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 40, 'sentence': 'Beautifully observed, miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama.'}, {'sentence_id': 41, 'sentence': &quot;What makes How I Killed My Father compelling, besides its terrific performances, is Fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 42, 'sentence': &quot;This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again, even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book.&quot;}, {'sentence_id': 43,
